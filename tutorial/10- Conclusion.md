You've made it until the end of this tutorial ðŸ™‚

This very simple dapp introduced a lot of different concepts that are fundamental to developing applications on Tezos, but also to understanding how Tezos works in general.

Taquito is an amazing library to develop on Tezos, whether you want to prototype ideas quickly or want to create full-stack decentralized applications. It provides a main library with all you need to read from the Tezos blockchain, interact with smart contracts and use wallets, and several smaller packages for specific usage, for example, reading token metadata or batching operations.

This tutorial also introduced different tools you may need on your journey to developing dapps on Tezos, The Beacon SDK to interact with wallets, the TzKT API to get more data from the blockchain, etc.

Although this tutorial uses Svelte as its framework of choice, the skills you learned are transferrable to other frameworks as they are based on a lot of the same concepts (the component lifecycles are very similar, etc.) It gives you everything you need to build amazing dapps on Tezos and I can't wait to see what you will build next!
